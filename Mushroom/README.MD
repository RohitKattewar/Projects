Project Description : 
This data set represents the descriptions of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family (pp. 500-525).

Each species is identified as definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or of unknown edibility and not recommended. This latter class was combined with the poisonous one. The Guide clearly states that there is no simple rule for determining the edibility of a mushroom. This Dataset contains total 8145 rows and 23 columns.

So, with the help of using ML different algorithms and classifications we determine if a certain mushroom is edible or poisonous by its specifications like cap shape, cap color, gill color, etc. using different classifiers.
